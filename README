This is a source service for Open Build Service.
Instead of running a set of services in the "_services" file based on a given mode, it will run
the sequence of services in a user-specified file.  The intermediate files are not deleted
so that services may chain intermediate results without having to commit them
Any failure in the sequence will cause the service to abort without executing additional services.

This is particularly intended to be used in conjunction with pattern-service, so the resource limits
apply only to specified services after generation, not to the generation process itself.
